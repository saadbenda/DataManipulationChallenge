# Data Manipulation Challenge description & instructions
In this challenge, you will have to load and manipulate satellite images, as you could be doing if you join Kayrros. Data manipulation is one of the core skills one should master, even before thinking about fancy algorithms and data pipelines.

You will not be required any image specific knowledge, as we will provide you with the necessary guidelines.

Please keep your code clean and don't forget to comment your code. You are also encouraged to provide as much details as you can in markdown cells or in comments, even if you have ideas you do not have time to explore. We will evaluate the cleanness of your code as much as your results.

Have fun !
